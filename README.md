# fn_MD_FDA
Fibronectin (fn) steered molecular dynamics (MD) and force distribution analysis (FDA) tutorial
==========
This is an instruction manual for running steered a molecular dynamics simulation (constant pulling force of 1000 pN) of a single fibronectin subunit, specifically residues 1326-1418. All input files required to run the simulations are in `./fn_MD_FDA/input/`. Completed simulation trajectories for postprocessing can be found in: `./fn_MD_FDA/complete/`. This tutorial walks you through how to get these outputs from scratch and all the simulations can be done on a modern laptop with 1-3 hour runtime depending on specifications. However, you may choose to download the trajectory files and view the results in VMD. 

Downloading Gromacs
===========
On Linux, the most straightforward way to download gromacs is by entering `sudo apt install gromacs` in the command line. However, another option is to download the source code and build it manually, which is described below for Gromacs 2020.4.

This implementation was run in Ubuntu 20.04. The molecular dynamics software used was Gromacs 2020.4, which can be downloaded from https://ftp.gromacs.org/pub/gromacs/ and is also available in the `./fn_MD_FDA/.` The source code can be downloaded from https://manual.gromacs.org/2020.4/download.html. The tarball can be unpacked using:
```
tar -xvzf gromacs-2020.4.tar.gz
```
Please refer to the gromacs installation guide found in https://manual.gromacs.org/2020.4/install-guide/index.html. 

If you run into installation errors, you may need to install compilers and cmake. To get the latest version of the C and C++ compilers, run:
```
sudo apt-get install g++
```
Then:
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```
To install the latest version of cmake:
```
sudo apt get install cmake
```
First, we will move the gromacs-2020.4 folder from its current location to the folder where our programs are kept. For my PC, this folder is `C:/Program Files`. For MacOS, this will be the Applications folder. Next, weâ€™re going to open up the terminal and navigate to the folder containing gromacs-2020.4. Now we can follow the "Quick and dirty installation" steps from the GROMACS website:
```
cd gromacs-2020.4
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON
make
make check
sudo make install
source /usr/local/gromacs/bin/GMXRC
```
Setting up the simulation
==========

Reminder: all input files required to run the simulations are in `./fn_MD_FDA/input/`

Move into the input directory on Linux and convert the pdb file to a gro file:
```
gmx pdb2gmx -f fn_1326-1418.pdb -o fn.gro
```
Select AMBER99SB-ildn force field and TIP3P.

Solvate
```
gmx solvate -cp fn.gro -cs spc216.gro -o solv.gro -p topol.top
```
Add ions:
```
gmx grompp -f ions.mdp -c solv.gro -p topol.top -o ions.tpr
```
```
gmx genion -s ions.tpr -o solv_ions.gro -p topol.top -pname NA -nname CL -neutral -conc 0.15
```
Select the SOL option.

Minimization
==========

NOTE: Minimization can take ~10-20 minutes on a modern laptop depending on how many cores you have. 
```
gmx grompp -f minim.mdp -c solv_ions.gro -p topol.top -o em.tpr
```
```
gmx mdrun -v -deffnm em
```
Energy can be extracted to an xvg file using:
```
gmx energy -f em.edr -s em.tpr -o em.xvg
```
Equilibration
==========

NVT:
```
gmx grompp -f nvt.mdp -c em.gro -p topol.top -r em.gro -o nvt.tpr
```
```
gmx mdrun -v -deffnm nvt
```
NPT:
```
gmx grompp -f npt.mdp -c nvt.gro -p topol.top -r nvt.gro -t nvt.cpt -o npt.tpr
```
```
gmx mdrun -v -deffnm npt
```
The RMSD can be calculated with:
```
gmx rms -s npt.tpr -f npt.trr -o rmsd.xvg
```
OR
```
gmx rms -s npt.tpr -f npt.xtc -o rmsd.xvg
```
And then selecting the protein option twice. The xtc trajectory file is a compressed version of the trr trajectory file.

The energy, temperature, and pressure can be extracted with:
```
gmx energy -f npt.edr -s npt.tpr -o output.xvg
```
Steered MD
==========

Define pull groups on fibronectin:
```
gmx make_ndx -f npt.gro
```
Type:
```
a1420
```
Press enter/return. Check to see the next available number slot. For example, if the group number stops at 18, use the next available number, which would be 19:
```
name 19 pull
```
Press enter/return. This selected the alpha-carbon on Aspartic Acid residue 1418 (atom number 1420 in the fn.gro file) as the atom to pull.

Type:
```
a5
```
Press enter/return. 

We now have to select another atom to hold. Type:
```
name 20 hold
```
Press enter/return twice. This selected the alpha-carbon on the Glycine residue 1326 (atom number 5 in the fn.gro file) as the atom to hold.

Press q and then enter to save and quit. 

Next, we create constraints
```
gmx genrestr -f npt.gro -n index.ndx -o R_pull.itp
```
Type the number next to the pull group and press enter.
```
gmx genrestr -f npt.gro -n index.ndx -o R_hold.itp
```
Type the number next to the hold group and press enter.

These position restraints also need to be defined in their respective protein chain .itp files. For the restraint on the hold group, we can add the following to the bottom of the posre.itp file and to the topol.top file after "; Include Position restraint file":
```
#ifdef R_hold
#include "R_hold.itp"
#endif
```
For the restraint on the pull group, we can add the following to the bottom of the posre.itp file and to the topol.top file after "; Include Position restraint file":
```
#ifdef R_pull
#include "R_pull.itp"
#endif
```
We must open up the R_hold.itp and R_pull file to manually renumber the left-most column, i. This column will contain the original atom numbers, which confuses GROMACS because position restraint (.itp) files always start with the number 1. So we have to go in and manually change ALL the atom numbers in R_pull.itp and R_hold.itp to 1, 2, 3 and so on. However, for this case, there is only one atom, so they each get labeled as "1". This seems silly, but it actually affects with atom gets pulled. If we don't renumber them in this way, Gromacs can't find the pull or hold atom and nothing gets pulled. 

Add the following to the pull.mdp at the top if it is not already there:
```
define = -DR_hold -DR_pull
```
Running the steered MD.
```
gmx grompp -f pull_fn.mdp -c npt.gro -p topol.top -r npt.gro -n index.ndx -t npt.cpt -o pull_fn.tpr
```
```
gmx mdrun -v -deffnm pull_fn -s pull_fn.tpr -pf pullforce.xvg -px pullext.xvg
```
To calcualte the end-to-end distance and radius of gyration of the protein we can use the following command, then select "Protein"
```
gmx polystat -s pull_fn.tpr -f pull_fn.xtc -n index.ndx -o end2end.xvg
```
Force Distribution Analysis
==============
To run the force distribution analysis, gromacs-fda will need to be installed from https://github.com/HITS-MBM/gromacs-fda. Use the input file found in `./fn_MD_FDA/input/input.pfi` and the steered MD trajectory of choice: 
```
gmx_fda mdrun -nt 1 -rerun pull_fn.xtc -pfi input.pfi -pfn index.ndx -s pull_fn.tpr -psr output.psr
```
Post-processing - Trajectory
===============

Download and open VMD 1.9.4a https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD. Click `file > New molecule > browse` and open `./fn_MD_FDA/output/npt.gro`. In main VMD window, right click the `npt.gro` molecule (which should be highlighted) and click `Load data into molecule` and select `./fn_MD_FDA/output/pull_fn.xtc`  Then click `Load` in the Molecule File Browser window. The trajectory should now be loaded in the display. 

Go to `Graphics > Representations` and under `Drawing Method` select `NewCartoon`. The cartoon representation should be displayed now and the water and ions should be hidden. 

Now go to `Extensions > VMD Preferences` and go to the Custom tab. Click `New` and name it "pf_loaduser". In the "code" box, write the following lines, but replacing the "path/to/pf_loaduser.tcl" with the location of the `pf_loaduser.tcl` script. This script is available in the `fn_MD_FDA` directory. In my local PC, I moved the `pf_loaduser.tcl` file to `"C:/Program Files/VMD/plugins/WIN64/tcl/pf_loaduser.tcl"`.
```
source "path/to/pf_loaduser.tcl"
package require pf_loaduser
```
Click "Update" and then "Push All Settings to VMD". Close out of the VMD Preferences Panel. 

Now go to `Extensions > TkConsole` and type `pbc box` and hit `enter` to display the simulation cell. Now, in the TkConsole, using cd and ls, navigate to the folder containing the cloned repository and find the output.psr file in `path/to/fn_MD_FDA/output/`. For my local PC, I use `cd "C:/Users/andre/Documents/GitHub/fn_MD_FDA/output"`. Remove the first frame by typing the command:
```
animate delete beg 0 end 0 skip 0 0
```
Source the pf_loaduser.tcl file in the TKConsole, replacing `path/to/pf_loaduser.tcl` with the directory that contains your `pf_loaduser.tcl` file:
```
source "path/to/pf_loaduser.tcl"
```
Load the pf_loaduser script:
```
package require pf_loaduser
```
The following command will overlay the FDA results onto the molecule:
```
pf_loaduser "output.psr" true 1 BWR
```
The TkConsole should print out "now loading per-residue data" and after a few seconds to a minute, the results should be shown on the molecule itself. You can scroll through the trajectory and see how the different regions within the fibronectin beta sheets activate to resist the unwinding. The final video can be seen in `fn_1326-1418_fda_traj.mp4`.
